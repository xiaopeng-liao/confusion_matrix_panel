# This is a project to provide confusion matrix to Grafana

The idea is coming from the daily job requirement, quite often we need to train the model for quite some time, sometimes we generates confusion matrix graph, however, it would be much nicer to be able to monitor it right away. 

On the other hand, Grafana is a such a nice tool which is easy to setup and use, therefore introduce confusion matrix to it will be a nature selection.

This is a on going project, it will have something out really soon.
